            When you make a trip into a cave, you will find some number of
            emeralds and some number of sapphires. Some caves may have more
            emeralds than others, and some
            caves may have more sapphires than others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time you take a trip into a cave, the number of emeralds and
            sapphires you find there might be a little different. However, the
            average number of emeralds and sapphires found in each of the caves
            doesn't change over the course of an expedition, and caves don't
            "run out" of gems.

            Your goal is to mine the most <strong>total</strong> gems on each expedition.
            Throughout the expedition, the game will keep track of how many gems you've
            mined. Emeralds and sapphires are counted equally&mdash;each counts as one gem
            towards your total.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the game, one of your expeditions will be chosen at
            random and you will receive a cash bonus based on your gem total for
            that expedition. The gems are converted to money at a rate of 20
            gems to 1 cent.
