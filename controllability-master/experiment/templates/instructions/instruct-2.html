            Whenever you visit a grove, there are three bird species you might
            spot: bluebirds, greenbirds, and redbirds. On any one trip you may
            spot zero species, one species, or multiple species. Your goal is to
            spot as many bird species as you can on each trip.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some bird species may tend to prefer a single grove, while others
            may appear randomly throughout the six groves in a forest. Some
            species may appear more often in some forests than in other forests.
            The three species ignore each other, so the presence of one bird
            species won't make another one more or less likely to appear.

        Each time you choose a grove, the "trips in forest" counter will
        decrease by one, the birds you've spotted will be displayed below the
        grove icons, and the "birds spotted" counter will increase by the number
        of species spotted on that trip. The "trips in forest" and "birds
        spotted" counters will reset on each expedition to a new forest. At the
        end of the game, one of your expeditions will be chosen at random and you
        will receive a cash bonus based on the number of total birds spotted on
        that expedition. The birds spotted are converted to money at a rate of one cent
        per bird.
