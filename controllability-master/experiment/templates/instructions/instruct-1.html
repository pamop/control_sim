            In this experiment you will play the role of a naturalist guiding
            bird-watching trips. You will make a series of expeditions to different
            forests. Each expedition lasts 30 days, and on each day you will
            lead one bird-watching trip.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each forest you visit will have six groves. On each trip you will have to
            choose which of the six groves to visit. To choose a grove, click
            on its tree icon.
